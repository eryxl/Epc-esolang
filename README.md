# Epc-esolang
A esoteric language fully made for frontend. also dont use this on mondays...

how to use it?
it is very simple... first start with this code 
```<script src="//eryxapis.netlify.app/esolang.js"></script>```
and then ``` <script>
    const epcFileContent = '//whatever code you want';
    processEpcContent(epcFileContent);
  </script>```

How do I begin?
it has a few things it can do as of right now. Inside of the epcfilecontent constant you can put code like ```send "Hello, World!"```  ```>this is a comment``` and ```graphics.square(50, 50, 100, "rgb(255, 0, 0)")``` the first number is x location, the second number is y location, the third number is size, and last is color.
